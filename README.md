# Stands
A website which correlates aircraft on the VATSIM network with stands. Used for Scandinavian airports, but available to use on all airports with Open Street Map data available.
Created by [Daniel L.](https://github.com/blt950) (1352906), based on the [stand plugin from Alex Toff](https://github.com/atoff/vatsim-stand-status).

# Installing

## Docker Image
- Pull the `ghcr.io/vatsim-scandinavia/stands:latest` Docker image
- Add your [environment variables](#Environment-variables)
- Bind the `/public/data/` folder to a folder on your host machine to presist or modify the data
- Start the container and setup your reverse proxy
- Done!

*You may also use the docker-compose file in the repository to get started, just tweak it to your liking.*

## Manual
- To install the website, you require PHP 7.4 or greater.
- When the content is installed, use `composer install` to install the required dependencies.
- Make sure the `/vendor/cobaltgrid/vatsim-stand-status/storage/data` and `vendor/skymeyer/vatsimphp/app/cache` and `vendor/skymeyer/vatsimphp/app/logs` folders are writeable
- Done!

# Caching
This application uses the OPCache to cache the compiled PHP code. Default setting is for production which means that the cache is not cleared automatically. To clear the cache, you need to restart the container if you change a file.

For development, change `validate_timestamps` to `1` in the `/usr/local/etc/php/php.ini` file to make sure that the cache is cleared automatically when a file is changed.

# Configuring

## Environment variables
- `APP_TRACKING_SCRIPT` - A script that will be inserted in the header of the page. This can be used to add your Google Analytics or similar scripts.

## Data

By default the service will feed off data from Open Street Map. However, there's a possiblity to enrich and verify the airport data with manual data source in json.

First of all, make sure the `data/index.json` is updated with the airports you want to display in the menu.
Then you can supply airport data with stands, coordinates and category of stands in `data/<icao>.json` for the airports of choice. See example airports that are already uploaded.

The stand category is shown in the tooltip when hovering mouse of a stand, but also to decide the size of the ring.

Tip: When dealing with overlapping stands like L/R-stands, the tooltip gets drawn in the same order as the file. You might want to draw the biggest stand first, then the overlaps so you can view them all.
